          <h4 class="alert-heading">Goals to uplift society with Education</h4>
          <p>Education is going through a big transition due to the ongoing changes in the way we use technology and the way we communicate. Online availability of the content has brought about revolutionary changes in the learning process of the students. Because the content is anyway available, so the level of learning has shifted to the next grade.

            Many organizations are changing themselves to cope up with the changes taking place in the educational space. Others will be either forced to change or they will face the consequences of not making up with the changes.
            
            New terms in the teaching learning pedagogy are being discussed and debated in the academic forums. Self-paced learning, blended learning, collaborative learning, competency-based learning, experiential learning, project-based learning, research-led learning, deep learning, online learning and mobile learning all form the buzzwords of the 21st century classrooms.</p>
          <hr>
          <p class="mb-0">All these practices may bring some innovation in the delivery of the courses and may enhance the quality of the outcome. The real change will come with the change in the mindset of the leadership behind the institutions. The vision and mission of the educational institutions need to change from product delivery to societal change. We don’t want lengthy manuscripts written for various journals for the purpose of publications but we need real action along with the novel thoughts to bring about the change in the lives of people. Actual interventions involving latest breakthroughs should be of much more importance than having research grants for incremental changes in existing research.

            The institution which is acting as an enabler for uplifting the society will have few characteristics that will take it to higher pedestal than others. First key point will be that there cannot be any boundaries (read regulations) on anything concerning the teaching learning process. Here we are assuming that you have a critical mass of genuine and sincere faculty on board.</p>

          <h4 class="alert-heading">Our Achievements</h4>
          <p>Academic achievement was once thought to be the most important outcome of formal educational experiences and while there is little doubt as to the vital role such achievements play in student life and later (Kell, Lubinski, & Benbow, Citation2013), researchers and policy makers are ever increasingly turning to social and emotional factors, as well as the relationships among them, as indicators of student well-being and psychological development (Chernyshenko, Kankaraš, & Drasgow, Citation2018; Frydenberg, Martin, & Collie, Citation2017; Moore, Mok, Chan, & Lai, Citation2006). Indicative of this movement is the recent addition of social and emotional measures to established Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) measures (e.g. PISA, OECD, Citation2019). These measures include, according to Chernyshenko et al. (Citation2018), emotional regulation (e.g. stress resistance, optimism), task performance (e.g. motivation, persistence, self-control) and compound skills (e.g. metacognition, self-efficacy). Consistent with this theme, you will find six quality empirical studies in this Issue that examine some of the complexities of such factors, some related to academic achievement, others not, having a legitimacy in their own right.</p>
          <hr>
          <p class="mb-0">Academic achievement plays a role in the studies by Colmar, Liem, Connor, and Martin(2019) and Martinez, Youssef-Morgan, Chambel, and Marques-Pinto (2019). For Colmaret al. (2019), the capacity of elementary school students to respond to academic setbacks,academic buoyancy, was not predictive of academic achievement. However, academicbuoyancy effects were demonstrated for both reading and mathematics achievement inAustralian students when mediated by self-concept. Psychological capital resources (e.g.efficacy, hope, optimism, resilience) are foregrounded in Martinez et al.’s(2019) examin-ation of Spanish/Portugese university students’engagement and achievement. Their find-ings showed that students who report being engaged in learning are more likely to beusers of psychological capital who in turn are more likely to achieve higher academically..</p>

        <h4 class="alert-heading">Library</h4>
        <p>A library is a collection of books, and possibly other materials and media, that is accessible for use by its members and members of allied institutions. Libraries provide physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection normally includes printed materials which can be borrowed, and a reference section of publications which are not permitted to leave the library and can only be viewed inside the premises. There may be other physical resources in many formats, such as commercial releases of films, television programmes, other video recordings, radio, music and audio recordings on DVD, Blu-ray, CD and cassette, besides access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="mb-0">Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources, such as computers and access to the Internet. The library's clientele and services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library or academic library, for example. Libraries may also be community hubs, where programmes are made available and people engage in lifelong learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of the building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet.

          The services that libraries offer are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination "library and information services", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently.</p>

        <h4 class="alert-heading">Faculty</h4>
        <p>Rajeev Kumar had acted as a whistleblower during his tenure in IIT Kharagpur where he unearthed several financial and academic malpractices. In 2006, he complained of large-scale irregularities in the JEE exam. At this time, M. Jagadesh Kumar, who was JNU vice-chancellor from 2016 to 2022, had been a member of the Joint Admission Board of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and an IIT Delhi faculty. Rajeev Kumar joined JNU in 2015.

          Rajeev Kumar had filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court seeking transparency in the JEE. In 2011, the apex court called him an unsung hero. After his petition, the IITs made several changes like allowing candidates to take back carbon copies of their answer sheets.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="mb-0">The JNU administration set up an inquiry in February 2020, when Jagadesh Kumar was VC. Since then, Rajeev Kumar has written to the President several times. The President's secretariat has forwarded the petitions to the education ministry for necessary action and filing a status report. The ministry has, in turn, sent the petitions to JNU. The university is not known to have submitted its response so far.

          In his latest letter to the President, Rajeev Kumar has contended that the inquiry was without substance. He has stated that the second complainant was not eligible to attend the meeting because he was a retired faculty member.</p>

        <h4 class="alert-heading">Play Ground</h4>
        <p>A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed to provide an environment for children that facilitates play, typically outdoors. While a playground is usually designed for children, some are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities. A playground might exclude children below (or above) a certain age.

          Modern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development. Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.
          
          Playgrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball.</p>

        <p class="mb-0">However, it was only in the early 20th century, as the street lost its role as the default public space and became planned for use by motor cars, that momentum built to remove children from the new dangers and confine them to segregated areas to play. In the United States, organisations such as the National Highway Protective Society highlighted the numbers killed by automobiles, and urged the creation of playgrounds, aiming to free streets for vehicles rather than children's play.[8][9] The Outdoor Recreation League provided funds to erect playgrounds on parkland, especially following the 1901 publication of a report on numbers of children being run down by cars in New York City.[10]</p>

        <p>A school assembly is a gathering of all or part of a school for various purposes, such as special programs or communicating information.[1] In some schools, students may to perform a common song or prayer, receive announcements, or present awards. A routine attendance check may be done in such gatherings. At some schools, these meetings may be substituted by smaller classroom gatherings (sometimes called form or home room) and announcements broadcast over a public address system. Periodic school assemblies can be a forum for special presenters of educational, health, or safety materials, or for school plays, talent shows, etc..</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="mb-0">School assemblies are usually held in school halls or in outdoor areas such as the school sports complex or basketball courts. School assemblies are held weekly, usually on Mondays. Students sing the national, state, and school anthems while raising the national flag. They recite the Rukun Negara and hear reports, speeches and announcements from the principal, teachers, and prefects. Assemblies usually last for an hour. Schools also have smaller assemblies every other day where students gather before the start of their first class or when the first bell rings. Teachers and students often make quick and simple announcements for 15 minutes before sending the students to their classrooms. Schools in Malaysia use the homeroom system. This daily gathering prevents students from playing truant as class monitors take attendance when the students are in the hall, loitering before class starts. This makes it easier to catch and punish those who are tardy.[10]</p>
